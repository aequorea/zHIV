I started by designing an HIV blocking molecule, a glycosylated neutralizer based on the N6 antibody. The N6 antibody has the property that it binds the CD4 binding site on HIV's gp120 protein mostly with one chain -- the heavy chain. The light chain doesn't actually do very much. In fact, the paper describing the antibody suggests that it "evolved" to stay out of the way. This allowed the majority of the antibody to be cut away leaving a small molecule. By getting the light chain even more out of the way than it is in the original antibody, the neutralizer might be able to bind the CD4 binding site more effectively than the original complete antibody. It might even bind some of the HIV isolates that the original full sized N6 can't. It would be very nice to know if this is the case.

There is evidence that in many cases, an HIV infection is caused by a single virus particle which makes its way in and then spreads. This causes a "genetic bottleneck" that can be seen if the sequences of the virus is tracked from the beginning. Something the bottleneck data tells us is that the first viruses that get in have fewer glycosylation sites than ones that are the result of an infection that has been going on for a while. In other words, it appears that HIV may let down it's "glycan shield" a bit to get in. It's fair to speculate that the possible lack of glycans merely unmasks a binding site on the protein surface, the CD4 binding site for example. On the other hand, the glycans may be doing something else completely. For example they might be acting to hinder endocytosis. If this is the case we might like the blocking molecule to be glycosylated to prevent alternative modes of HIV entry into host cells. There are also issues of solubility and mobility in mucus which glycosylation might help with. So the neutralizer is designed to be glycosylated.

Initially I was thinking the neutralizer might be a preventative molecule, an ingredient in some kind of "personal lube" engineered to prevent HIV infections, but it might also be useful as a theraputic. In this case, the designed-in glycans would be useful in preventing immunogenicity of the neutralizer itself and would work to lengthen the clearance time. Anti-retrovirals tend to breed viruses that are resistant to the medication. This is why in an attempt to avoid this issue, multiple drugs are administered simultaneously. It's still a numbers game though. We can reduce the probability of resistance, but we can't eliminate it. If we make a neutralizer that binds to the CD4 binding site on HIV with high specificity, and HIV evolves a resistance to it, one could argue that the virus is no longer HIV. If it lost the ability to bind CD4, it might lose its ability to specifically target the immune system. In this case the immune system might have a fighting chance to take care of the infection on its own.
