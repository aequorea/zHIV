The inspiration to design an HIV neutralizer came from the observation that lectins like griffithsin (Emau et al. 2007) have received significant interest as potential HIV microbicides where in principle, binding the HIV particleâ€™s glycan coat with lectins should act to prevent infection. However the HIV glycan coat is variable (Pantophlet 2014). Although the HIV glycan coat is dense on the average, it may be significantly variable on an HIV particle to HIV particle basis. There may be a number of HIV particles in any given population that have an insufficient number of glycans to ensure a dense enough coating of lectins to prevent viral entry. Furthermore, griffithsin and some other lectins that have been or are being considered as HIV neutralizers bind mannose moieties. All female reproductive tract epithelia express the mucin MUC1 (Gipson et al. 1997), and MUC1 has N-linked glycosylation that results in a glycan coat which may have mannose moieties (Parry 2006). So mannose binding lectins may just as easily bind mucus proteins as HIV and be prevented from reaching their target. So we want something that binds HIV specifically. Besides CCR5 utilization, the strongest phenotypic properties of Env linked to sexual transmission are shorter hypervariable domains and fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Pantophlet 2014). A reduction in glycosylation sites could be supporting viral entry for a variety of reasons, so to preserve the presentation of a dense glycan coat we want our neutralizer to have a dense glycan coat of it's own. This should also improve the solubility of the neutralizer.

Our design is a glycosylated neutralizer based on the N6 antibody (Huang et al. 2016), an antibody that has been shown to effectively neutralize 98% of 181 different HIV isolates that it was tested against. The N6 antibody has the property that it binds the CD4 binding site on HIV's gp120 protein mostly with one chain -- the heavy chain. The light chain has evolved to stay out of the way (Huang et al. 2016). This allowed the majority of the antibody to be cut away leaving a small molecule. By getting the light chain even more out of the way than it is in the original antibody, the neutralizer might be able to bind the CD4 binding site more effectively than the original complete antibody. It might even bind some of the HIV isolates that the original full sized N6 can't. It would be very nice to know if this is the case.
